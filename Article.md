## 🌍 Introduction
Forests play a vital role in maintaining global ecosystems, yet deforestation continues to threaten biodiversity, climate balance, and human livelihoods. This project supports **Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land**, which aims to conserve and restore terrestrial ecosystems.

---

## 🤖 The Problem
Illegal logging, land clearing, and forest degradation are major contributors to global warming and ecosystem destruction. Detecting deforestation early is critical, but traditional monitoring methods are slow and expensive.

---

## 💡 The Solution
Using **Artificial Intelligence**, this project leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on satellite imagery to detect and classify deforested regions automatically.

The system analyzes images to identify changes in forest coverage, providing a faster and more scalable approach to environmental monitoring.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Deforestation Dataset (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Accuracy:** 92% on validation data  
- **Tools Used:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Google Colab  

The model’s CNN architecture extracts image features such as texture and shape to differentiate between forested and deforested land.

---

## 🌱 Impact on SDG 15
This project directly supports **SDG Target 15.1**, promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.  
By detecting deforestation in real time, it helps:
- Environmental agencies monitor illegal logging  
- Policymakers take timely action  
- Promote reforestation and land restoration initiatives

## 📊 Results
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Training Accuracy | 95% |
| Validation Accuracy | 92% |
| Loss | Minimal after tuning |
