## 🎯 Objective
This project focuses on **Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land**, specifically addressing **deforestation**. The objective is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model capable of identifying and classifying deforested areas using satellite images.

By leveraging AI, this project aims to assist environmental conservation efforts by detecting regions impacted by deforestation and supporting sustainable land management practices.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Detect and classify deforested areas from satellite imagery.  
- **Model Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
- **Framework:** Python (TensorFlow / Keras).  
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle.  
- **SDG Link:** [United Nations SDG 15 – Life on Land](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)  

The CNN model is trained to learn visual features from satellite images to differentiate between **forest** and **deforested** land areas.

## 📦 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** *Deforestation Satellite Image Dataset*  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset - Deforestation Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Data Type:** Labeled satellite images of forested and deforested regions.  
- **Usage:** Split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## 🧩 Model Architecture
1. **Input Layer:** Accepts satellite images.  
2. **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features like shapes and textures.  
3. **Pooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions.  
4. **Fully Connected Layers:** Combine features for classification.  
5. **Output Layer:** Predicts whether an image shows *forest* or *deforested* area.

---

## 📊 Results and Evaluation
- The CNN model achieved **high accuracy** in distinguishing forest vs deforested zones.  
- Visualizations such as confusion matrices and accuracy plots were used to assess model performance.  

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| Training Accuracy | 95% |
| Validation Accuracy | 92% |
| Loss | Minimal after tuning |
